To run, create a server/auth.js file with the following contents:

```javascript
SPAWNER_HOST = "http://xx.xx.xx.xx" // address of your spawner machine
AUTH_TOKEN = "xxx" // auth token for your spawner
```

You also need to run a spawner like my [fredboxer-backend](https://github.com/juliosantos/fredboxer-backend)
